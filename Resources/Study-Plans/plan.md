# 🔥 90-Day HARDCORE Mastery Plan  
## Java + DSA + React.js (Never-Forget System)

> ⚠️ This is NOT a beginner plan.  
> ⚠️ This requires discipline, daily effort, and zero shortcuts.  
> 🎯 Goal: Master Java, DSA, and React so deeply that concepts stick permanently.

## ⏱ DAILY NON-NEGOTIABLE STRUCTURE

| Block | Time | Focus |
|-----|-----|------|
| Block 1 | 90 min | DSA (Java ONLY) |
| Block 2 | 60 min | Java Core / Internals |
| Block 3 | 60 min | React (same theme as Java/DSA) |
| Block 4 | 15 min | Explain + write notes from memory |

❌ No passive watching  
❌ No skipping DP  
✅ Code → Explain → Reuse → Revisit

## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLE (WHY THIS WORKS)

Every concept is:
1. Learned in **Java**
2. Practiced in **DSA**
3. Applied in **React**
4. Explained out loud
5. Revisited after **7 / 21 / 45 days**

This creates **long-term memory**.

- Object lifecycle

### DSA
- Arrays
- Strings
- Time & space complexity
- Two pointers

### React
- JSX & transpilation
- Render cycle

---

# 🟥 MONTH 3 — SYSTEM THINKING (SENIOR LEVEL)

## Week 9 — Design & Architecture
- Low-level design in Java
- Thread-safe services
- API contracts
- Error handling
- React architecture patterns

---

## Week 10 — FULL PROJECT (MANDATORY)

### Build ONE system:
**Task Management System**

#### Backend (Java preferred)
- Auth (JWT)
- Pagination
- Filtering
- Concurrency-safe services

#### Frontend (React)
- Dashboard
- Protected routes
- Caching
- Performance optimization

---

## Week 11 — Mock Interviews
- Daily timed DSA
- Java internals Q&A
- React debugging
- Explain everything out loud

🎯 Minimum: 5 mock interviews

---

## Week 12 — FINAL HARDENING
- Redo hardest problems
- Rewrite notes from memory
- Teach concepts (even to yourself)

---

# 🧠 NEVER-FORGET RULES

1. Java ONLY for DSA
2. Explain solutions out loud
3. Re-code after 7 days without notes
4. No copy-paste
5. One handwritten notebook
6. Sundays = revision only

---

## 🏆 END RESULT
If you finish this:
- You think in systems
- You don’t panic in interviews
- You explain Java & React internals confidently
- You are interview-dangerous

Most people quit by Week 4.  
If you don’t — you win.

## 💡 Success Tips

### For Beginners:
1. **Start with patterns**, not random problems
2. **Understand the "why"** before coding
3. **Solve Easy first** - build confidence
4. **Don't peek too early** - struggle for 30 min minimum

### For Intermediate:
1. **Time yourself** - simulate interview pressure
2. **Explain out loud** - practice communication
3. **Focus on edge cases** - corner cases matter
4. **Review weekly** - spaced repetition works

### For Advanced:
1. **Optimize everything** - time AND space
2. **Multiple approaches** - know alternatives
3. **Mock interviews** - practice with others
4. **Teach others** - best way to solidify

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ **Random Problem Solving** - Always study by pattern
2. ❌ **Tutorial Hell** - Watch less, code more
3. ❌ **Memorization** - Understand, don't memorize
4. ❌ **Skipping Easy** - Build foundation first
5. ❌ **No Review** - Review old problems weekly
6. ❌ **Ignoring Complexity** - Always analyze Big O
7. ❌ **Solo Study Only** - Discuss with others

---

## 📈 Recommended Order

**Week-by-Week Recommended Sequence:**

1. Arrays & Hashing → Foundation for everything
2. Two Pointers → Common interview pattern
3. Sliding Window → Extension of two pointers
4. Stack → Important for many problems
5. Binary Search → Must-know for sorted data
6. Linked List → Classic data structure
7. Trees → Fundamental hierarchical structure
8. Heap/Priority Queue → Advanced but common
9. Backtracking → Search problems
10. Graphs → Complex but frequent
11. Dynamic Programming 1D → Build up slowly
12. Rest of patterns → Based on interview needs
